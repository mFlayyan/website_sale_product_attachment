data.xml, model.py are generated by the script and are added to the project
in order to have a reference of the last generated data.

In the create...py script add password and username of the website to create a 
succesfull API connection.
this script is also used and called by the post init hook.


in the post init hook it is called to fetch the data migration policy, when called directly
it is used to generate the data and model.


MIGRATION PROCEDURE:
1.before migration: 
call the script as:  

create_magfields_definition_and_data.py databasewithconnector databaseusername

generate XML and PY copy in data.xml and product_product.py commit and push

2,the migration will initialize models and data, and the postinit hook will copy the data in the fields.


***** VERY IMPORTANT *****

When uninstalling this module be very carefull that the model.py and data have the same definitions you had when it was installed.
This is why the script should never be run alone.

currently the script creates new files:
product_template_imported_fields.py
imported_categories.xml


these can be deleted and recreated without disturbing the rest of the module.

there is not a uninstall hook that deletes them.

in previous versions, the models where appended to product product and the views were in data.xml if you are reinstalling on  this older version, take that into account.
uninstall that version and make a clean new install.
